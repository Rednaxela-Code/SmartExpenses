# SmartExpenses

SmartExpenses is a modern application for managing personal expenses, built with a layered architecture consisting of a frontend, backend, and shared logic.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `SmartExpenses.Client` – Frontend built with Vue.js  
- `SmartExpenses.Api` – Backend API built with ASP.NET Core (.NET 9)  
- `SmartExpenses.Core` – Domain logic and interfaces  
- `SmartExpenses.Data` – Data access layer using Entity Framework  
- `SmartExpenses.Shared` – Shared models and DTOs  

## ⚙️ Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed on your development machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
